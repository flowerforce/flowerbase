# Introduction to Flowerbase

**Flowerbase**, powered by **Flowerforce**, is a developer tool designed to simplify the creation of **serverless applications**, offering a modern, flexible, and scalable backend framework.

The project was built as a **replacement for MongoDB Realm**, which has now been deprecated, and aims to provide a complete and open alternative for building serverless backends using **Node.js**, **Fastify**, and **MongoDB**.

## üß© Tech Stack

Flowerbase is built on a set of modern and high-performance technologies:

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| **Node.js** | JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code. |
| **Fastify** | High-performance web framework used for defining APIs and serverless endpoints. |
| **MongoDB** | NoSQL database used for persistent data storage. |

This stack was chosen to ensure **speed, scalability, and developer productivity**.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure Overview

In this guide, we will analyze the **structure of the Flowerbase project** in detail, with a particular focus on its **core functionalities**.  
Each of these components plays a key role in the overall serverless workflow and contributes to making the platform modular and extensible.

The main functional areas covered are:

- **Functions** ‚Äì define and execute custom serverless logic.  
- **Triggers** ‚Äì automatically run functions in response to database or system events.  
- **Authentication** ‚Äì manage users, permissions, and secure access.  
- **HTTP/HTTPS Endpoints** ‚Äì expose serverless functions as RESTful APIs accessible via the web.  
- **Rules Management and Validation** ‚Äì define and validate data access rules to ensure security and consistency.

These sections will help contributors understand how the system is structured, how components interact, and how new features can be added or extended safely.
