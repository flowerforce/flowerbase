# Triggers

This section describes the **triggers** system, which is responsible for activating and managing triggers associated with different types of events.

---

## ðŸŒŽ Overview

The triggers system allows the registration of **functions** that are automatically executed when specific events occur within the application.

Each trigger is linked to a function that will be called whenever its corresponding event happens.

---

## âœ” Supported Event Types

- **DATABASE** â€“ triggered on database events such as *create*, *update*, and *delete*.  
- **SCHEDULED** â€“ triggered on scheduled events (cron-based).  
- **AUTHENTICATION** â€“ triggered on authentication-related events like *user creation*.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

```
src/features/triggers
â”œâ”€ index.ts # activates and registers triggers
â””â”€ utils.ts # contains handlers for the three trigger types
```

---

### `index.ts`

The `index.ts` file is the main entry point that **activates the trigger system**.  
It loads and registers all defined triggers, linking each to the corresponding function defined in the project configuration.

### `utils.ts`

This file defines the three handlers responsible for managing the behavior of each trigger type:

 - `handleDatabaseTrigger` â€“ handles database-related events.

 - `handleCronTrigger` â€“ manages scheduled (cron) triggers.

 - `handleAuthenticationTrigger` â€“ responds to authentication events.

Each handler ensures that the correct function is executed when its associated event occurs.
