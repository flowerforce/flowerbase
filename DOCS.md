# Flowerbase

**Flowerbase** is a server-side package designed to replicate the serverless features provided by MongoDB Atlas via Realm. Its primary goal is to allow seamless backend development through app-facing SDKs, enabling developers to build powerful, serverless applications with ease.

## Core Features

This package aims to reproduce the core server-side functionalities available in MongoDB Realm, including:

* **Rules**
* **Functions**
* **Triggers**
* **HTTP Endpoints**

> Below is an overview of each feature and its purpose.

---

### 🔐 Rules

Rules are defined via JSON files and are used to enforce fine-grained access control over your database operations. These rules determine what CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations can be performed on specific documents—or even parts of documents—based on various conditions.

This allows you to:

* Restrict or allow actions based on user roles or attributes
* Define permissions at the field or sub-document level
* Enforce read/write access policies for maximum security

>Example – rules.json
```json
{
    "database": "my-db",
    "collection": "example",
    "roles": [
        {
            "name": "readAll",
            "apply_when": {},
            "document_filters": {
                "read": true,
                "write": true
            },
            "insert": true,
            "delete": true,
            "search": true,
            "read": true,
            "write": true
        }
    ]
}

```

### ⚙️ Functions

Functions are JavaScript files executed in an isolated runtime environment. They are defined and configured in a central JSON file, where each function is listed and linked to its corresponding JS implementation.

These functions can be:

* Invoked directly from the frontend
* Used internally by triggers and HTTP endpoints
* Composed to create modular and reusable server-side logic


>Example – config.json
```json
[
  {
    "name": "sendWelcomeEmail",
    "private": false,
    "run_as_system": false
  }
]

```

>Example – functions/sendWelcomeEmail.js
```js
exports = function(user) {
  const email = user.email;
  const subject = "Welcome to Flowerbase!";
  const body = `Hello ${user.name}, thanks for signing up!`;
  
  // Hypothetical email service
  context.services.get("mailService").send(email, subject, body);
};

```
---

### 🔔 Triggers

Triggers are event listeners that execute functions in response to specific events. They are grouped into three main categories:

1. **Database Triggers**: Respond to changes in your database such as inserts, updates, or deletions.
2. **Authentication Triggers**: Fired during user authentication events, such as account creation or login.
3. **Scheduled Triggers**: Time-based triggers defined using cron expressions to run tasks periodically.

All triggers are configured via JSON files where you can:

* Set event criteria and parameters
* Define the function to be executed when the trigger fires

>Example – triggers/userSignupTrigger.json

```json
{
  "name": "userSignupTrigger",
  "type": "AUTHENTICATION",
  "event": "CREATE",
  "function": "sendWelcomeEmail",
  "disabled": false
}
```

>Example – triggers/itemUpdatedTrigger.json

```json
{
  "name": "itemUpdatedTrigger",
  "type": "DATABASE",
  "config": {
    "operation_types": ["UPDATE"],
    "database": "appDB",
    "collection": "items"
  },
  "function": "logItemUpdate",
  "disabled": false
}
```

### 🌐 HTTP Endpoints

HTTP Endpoints provide a way to expose custom backend logic as public or protected API routes that your frontend can call directly.

Each endpoint is defined using a JSON file, where you specify:

* The HTTP method and path
* Authentication requirements
* The handler function to be executed upon request

These endpoints allow you to build flexible APIs tailored to your application’s needs, without spinning up an entire backend infrastructure.

>Example – httpEndpoints/getUserProfile.json
```json
{
  "name": "getUserProfile",
  "route": "/user/profile",
  "methods": ["GET"],
  "function": "getUserProfile",
  "authentication": true
}
```

>Example – functions/getUserProfile.js
```js
exports = function(payload, response) {
  const userId = context.user.id;
  const users = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("appDB").collection("users");

  return users.findOne({ ownerId: userId });
};

```

<a id="project-structure"></a>
## 1. 📁 Project Structure


The core implementation of the Flowerbase package is located inside:

`packages/flowerbase/src`


Within this directory, you’ll find six main components:

---

#### 1. `auth/` – 🔐 Authentication Module

This folder contains the complete implementation of the authentication system.  
It includes the logic for managing user sign-up, login, password hashing, and session handling.

---

#### 2. `features/` – ✨ Core Features

This folder houses all the primary features and domain-specific logic supported by Flowerbase, like functions, services, http-endpoints and triggers.

---

#### 3. `services/` – 🔧 External Services

Here you’ll find service implementations that are injected into the context and used across the app.  
Examples include:

- `api`: HTTP services or internal endpoints
- `aws`: AWS service integration utilities

---

#### 4. `utils/` – 🛠 Utility Functions

This folder provides a set of utilities, mainly used for:

- Validating filters and rules
- Creating the context used within Functions
- Encrypting passwords
- Reusable helpers shared across the app

---

#### 5. `index.ts` – 🚀 Entry Point

This file exports the `initialize()` function, which is called when Flowerbase is integrated into your project.  
It wires together the services, features, and authentication into a working app instance.

---

#### 6. `state.ts` – 🗂 Shared State Manager

A lightweight state management module for holding shared runtime utilities and global instances.  
Used internally across modules to avoid duplication and support application-wide behaviors.



<a id="http-endpoints"></a>
## 2. 🌐 HTTP Endpoints

Inside the `src/features/endpoints` directory, you'll find the file:

`index.ts`



This file defines the `generateEndpoints` function, which plays a crucial role in setting up dynamic HTTP endpoints in your Flowerbase-powered app.

#### 🔧 What It Does

- Reads endpoint configurations from the `json` files provided at the application level (where Flowerbase is used).
- Automatically creates corresponding HTTP endpoints inside the fastify app.
- Associates each endpoint with the appropriate handler function as defined in the configuration.

This approach allows flexible and centralized endpoint definition, making it easy to scale or modify API routes without hardcoding logic.


<a id="functions"></a>
## 3. ⚙️ Functions

Inside the `src/features/functions` directory, you'll find the file:

`index.ts`

The Realm SDK (e.g., Realm Web) communicates with server-side functions by making requests to the following endpoint:

```code
/functions/call
```


This endpoint is registered in the `index.ts` file and is handled by the `functionsController` defined in `controller.ts`.

---

#### 🛡 Authentication Hook

Before any function is executed, a `preHandler` hook is triggered.  
This hook ensures that the request is authenticated before continuing to process the function call.

---

#### 🛠 Endpoints

Two main endpoints are registered for function invocation:

- `POST /functions/call`:  
  Called by the frontend to execute a server-side function with a given payload.

- `GET /functions/call`:  
  Used for watch operations on MongoDB collections, enabling reactive features in the frontend.

---

#### 🔄 Context Creation

Every time a function is executed, Flowerbase generates a fresh execution context via the `generateContext` utility.  
This ensures isolation and allows access to useful resources during execution.

#### Each function receives a `context` object, which includes:

- `context.services`: Access to MongoDB and other configured services  
- `context.user`: Information about the authenticated user  
- `context.http`: Ability to make outgoing HTTP requests  
- `context.values`: Read application-wide configuration variables
